# Step-by-Step Git Setup and Push Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" button** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in repository details:**
   - Repository name: `ecommerce-ai-agent` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `AI-powered e-commerce data analysis agent with natural language to SQL conversion`
   - Make it **Public** (so interviewers can see it)
   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. Copy the **HTTPS URL** that looks like:
```
https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-ai-agent.git
```

## Step 3: Configure Git (Do this once)

Replace with your actual information:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@gmail.com"
```

## Step 4: Add Files and Commit

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Add all new documentation files
git add README.md INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md DEPLOYMENT.md GIT_SETUP.md PROJECT_STATS.md .gitignore

# Check what's being added
git status

# Create the commit with a professional message
git commit -m "feat: Complete e-commerce AI data agent

- AI-powered natural language to SQL conversion using Google Gemini
- Processes real business data: $1,004,904.56 in revenue (702 sales records)
- Handles 3,696 ad metrics records with 791.58% RoAS analysis
- 4,381 product eligibility records for advertising optimization
- Flask + PostgreSQL + Bootstrap production-ready architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and security measures
- Natural language interface for business intelligence"
```

## Step 5: Add Remote Repository

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-ai-agent.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v
```

## Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 7: Verify on GitHub

1. **Go to your repository URL** on GitHub
2. **Check that all files are there:**
   - README.md with your project description
   - All your Python files (app.py, models.py, etc.)
   - Documentation files (INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md, etc.)
3. **The README should display automatically** with your project overview

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Authentication Required
If GitHub asks for username/password:
- Use your GitHub username
- For password, use a **Personal Access Token** (not your account password)
- Generate token at: GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens

### Issue 2: Repository Already Exists
```bash
# If you need to change the remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/new-repo-name.git
```

### Issue 3: Permission Denied
```bash
# Make sure you have the correct remote URL
git remote -v
# If wrong, update it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/correct-repo-name.git
```

## Final Verification Commands

```bash
# Check your repository status
git status

# See your commit history
git log --oneline

# Check remote repositories
git remote -v
```

## What Interviewers Will See

2. **Complete documentation** showing your thoroughness
3. **Clean code structure** with proper organization
4. **Real business impact** with actual data processing
5. **Production readiness** with deployment guides

## Repository URL to Share
